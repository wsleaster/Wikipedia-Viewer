# Wikipedia-Viewer
A project I created for free code camp using HTML, CSS and Javascript

I created this project for free code camp using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It uses an ajax call to Wikipedia's API, type in anything into the input field and it searches Wikipedia for related articles witha  small preview and also a button to go to a random article on Wikipedia.
